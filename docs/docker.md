# Docker sysext

This sysext ships a custom [docker](https://docker.com)
The docker sysext comes with containerd and runc as bundled by upstream in https://download.docker.com/linux/static/stable/x86_64/.
It can be used to diverge from the docker included in Flatcar's OS image, e.g. to upgrade or downgrade manually, or to test a newer version than what's included in the stock OS image.

The sysext includes a service unit file to start containerd at boot and the docker daemon via socket activation, as well as basic configuration.

## Usage

Download and merge the sysext at provisioning time using the below butane snippet.
It deactivates the default containerd and docker included in the Flatcar OS image by masking the respective sysexts.

The snippet includes automated updates via systemd-sysupdate.
Sysupdate will stage updates and request a reboot by creating a flag file at `/run/reboot-required`.
You can deactivate updates by changing `enabled: true` to `enabled: false` in `systemd-sysupdate.timer`.

Note that the snippet is for the x86-64 version of docker 25.0.3.
