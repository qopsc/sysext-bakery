# Containerd sysext

This sysext ships a custom [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd).
It can be used to diverge from the containerd included in Flatcar's OS image, e.g. to upgrade or downgrade manually, or to test a newer version than what's included in the stock OS image.

The sysext includes a service unit file to start containerd at boot as well as a basic `containerd.toml` configuration.

## Usage

Download and merge the sysext at provisioning time using the below butane snippet.
It deactivates the default containerd included in the Flatcar OS image by masking the respective sysext.

The snippet includes automated updates via systemd-sysupdate.
Sysupdate will stage updates and request a reboot by creating a flag file at `/run/reboot-required`.
You can deactivate updates by changing `enabled: true` to `enabled: false` in `systemd-sysupdate.timer`.

Note that the snippet is for the x86-64 version of containerd 2.0.0.
